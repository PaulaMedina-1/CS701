 *  Collaborators: Carmine gave us some steps to follow for the implementation.

 *  Problem: Implementing the Sweep line algorithm
 *  Description: IImplementing sweep line algorithm to find if in a set of segments there are any intersections.
 *  The implementation has t be done using a Priority Queue(heapsort) and a tree for the first part of the assignment and radix
 *  sort and VEBtree for the second part. The next part of the assignment was implementing a method to find the rage of x-values
 *  and y-values. Depending on this range implement the intersection using either heapsort and AVL or radix sort and VEBtree. Lastly, we had to implement
 *  two different sets (smooth and sparse and run the part two algorithm to compare running times between the sets.
 *
 *  Input: Set of segments defined by two endpoints
 *  Output: True if there is an intersection, false if segments don't intersect.

 * Smooth set   n/a     n/a     n/a     n/a     n/a
 * Sparse set   n/a     n/a     n/a     n/a     n/a

 *What is the best function of n and/or u fitting your
 * measurements? Notice that you are evaluating rate of growth, you are
 * not being asked which one is faster. Are the results consistent with
 * the query time of the data structures and algorithms used? Justify
 * explaining the running time of each.
 *
 * In relation to a smooth set and a sparse set, the expected results are such
 * that the sparse set will expect to perform better
 * due to the nature of  the smooth set, we  are storing based on the index of the element.
 * As a result of the bit array in the sparse set,
 * as the input size increases we expect to see that the rate of growth should
 * be dramatically reduced. The sparse set with the bit array will asymptotically
 * grow at a significantly slower rate than that of the smooth set.
